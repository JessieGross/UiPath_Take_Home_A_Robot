# LinkedIn Bot Step-By-Step Guide

## What does it do?
Well, it saves you time. Just kidding but not kidding, this bot will wait until there's an article (pdf) in `Input` folder, analyze that article, automatically generate hashtags then post the whole thing to Linkedin, all within seconds.

Or if you have already have some files in the folder, the next time you run the robot, it will look for the newest file in the `Input` folder to post.

Sounds awesome? Let's move on.

## What do you need?
* `UiPath Studio`. Download community version (free) here.
    * https://www.uipath.com/developers/community-edition-download
* A basic understanding of UIPath Studio, e.g. how to create workflow, search and drag activities, install packages, create variables, scopes, selectors...
    * You can learn these from this free course: https://academy.uipath.com/learn/public/learning_plan/view/35/RPADeveloper
* A `LinkedIn` account (of course).
* A `Microsoft Azure` account to activate `Text Analytics Service` (but this is not necessary, we will provide you a test key, unless the test key doesn't work anymore or you want to use your own key). The instructions for this key will be at the end of the tutorial.

## Let's do it

> If you are looking into our demo workflow, make sure you change your email and password for it to launch properly.

### 1. Launch UiPath Studio

First things first, open UiPath Studio and create a Blank Process as shown below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/9VamsVr.gif)


### 2. Create the Skeleton Workflow

* In the `Flow Decision` put `Directory.GetFiles(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory + "\Input").Count > 0` in `Condition` under the `Properties` panel to check if there's any file in `Input` folder.

* Put `00:00:02` in `duration` in `delay` to only check if there's any file in `Input` folder every 2 seconds.

* Every process on the left is a `Try Catch` activity just like the image below.

### 3. Open & Login LinkedIn

Open www.linkedin.com in a browser. In this tutorial, we used Chrome. 

> Please use Chrome for the sake of stability. If you haven't dowloaded the Chorme Extension for UiPath Studio:
> In UiPath Studio, click `Start` > `Tools` > click `Chrome Extension` and install it.

* In the first `Try Catch` frame or `Open & Log into LinkedIn` block, use `Record` to log into LinkedIn. Instructions for this task is as follows:

* `Design` tab > `Recording` > `Web`
* The `Web Recording`  bar will pop up > click `Open Browser` (if you clicked on the down arrow, select `Open Browser` again) > click on the browser that has www.linkedin.com opened.
* On the `Web Recording` window > click`Record` > click the `Sign In` button on the LikedIn web page > click the `Email or Phone` option and type your account > do the same for `Password` and select the `Type password` option to mask and obscure it. Select the `Empty field` option to empty any content that may be existing in the field.
* On your keyboard hit `Esc` > click `Save & Exit`.

> This `Recording` progress can be found in the `Main` workflow as a `Web` block. Move this in your `Try Catch` block by cut and paste.

### 4. Read File & Generate Hashtags
This part is going to be a bit challenging, but don't worry, we will make it as clear as possible.
* In the first `Assign` activity create a variable `folderPath` and put `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory + "\Input"` in the right box.
    * This will get the directory to `Input` folder.
    
* In the second `Assign` activity create a variable `lastModFile` and put `Directory.GetFiles(folderPath,"*.*",SearchOption.AllDirectories).OrderByDescending(Function(d) New FileInfo(d).CreationTime).Tolist(0)`.
    * This is just a piece of Visual Basic code to get the newest file in the folder.
    * Make sure the scope of 'lastModFile' is GLOBAL to the whole flow chart.
    
* `Attended Robot Status` is just to output a message to the screen and you can put any message in double quotes in its `Message` property.
    * If you don't have `Attended Robot Status`, go to `Manage Packages` and search for `AttendedRobotStatus` in `All Packages`.
* If you don't have `Read PDF with OCR`, install `UiPath.PDF.Activities` in `Manage Packages` and put `lastModFile` into it.
    * Drag `Microsoft OCR` activity into it as a scanning engine and create a variable called`articleContent` in property `Text` of `Microsoft OCR`.
* If you don't have `Microsoft Text Analysis`, install `UiPath.Cognitive.Activities`.
    * In its properties, set `Key` = `"fd0ca4c4139a4111b4a5280b65d512bc"` (this is for testing purposes, you can use yours).
    * Set `Text` to `articleContent`.
    * Set `AnalysisType` to `KeyPhrases`.
    * Create new variable `keyPhrases` in `KeyPhrases`.
* In the `For Each` loop, we have:
    * `tag` = `item.ToString.Replace(" ", "").Insert(0, "#").Replace("-","").Replace("'","")` to clean the string.
    * `hashtags` = `String.Join(" ", hashtags, tag)` to create a string of hashtags. Make sure `hashtags` is GLOBAL to the whole workflow.

### 5. Post Article to Linkedin
Use Web Recorder to post the article to LinkedIn
* Click on the attachment icon on your logged in home page.
* Paste the `lastModFile` into `File Name` of the window popped up.

You will have something like this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/U1er9xd.png)


* put `hashtags` into the first `Type Into` activity.
* Assign `fileName` to `Path.GetFileName(lastModFile)` to get the title of the file.
* Put `filename.Replace(".pdf", "")` into the second `Type Into` activity to delete the ".pdf".
* 'Click' Post.

> If you get stuck with the selectors (LinkedIn is a bit tricky), use our selectors:
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />
` for the first and second outter "attached browser"'s selectors.
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl aaname='            Upload document   ' idx='2' />` for clicking attachment button.

> In the second "attach browser":
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl aaname='   What do you want to talk about?      ' />` for the "Type Hashtags".
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl id='document-share-preview__title-input' tag='INPUT' />` for the "Type Title".
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl tag='BUTTON' aaname='            Post  ' />` for the "Click Post".
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl tag='BUTTON' aaname='         Dismiss ' class='artdeco-toast-item__dismiss artdeco-button artdeco-button--circle artdeco-button--muted artdeco-button--1 artdeco-button--tertiary ember-view' parentclass='artdeco-toast-item artdeco-toast-item--visible ember-view' />` for the "Click Dismiss".

You will have something like this:
