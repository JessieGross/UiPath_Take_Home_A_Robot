# LinkedIn Bot Step-By-Step Guide

## What does it do?
Well, it saves you time. Just kidding but not kidding, this bot will wait until there's an article (pdf) in `Input` folder (pdf), analyze that article, automatically generate hashtags then post the whole thing to Linkedin, all within seconds.

Sounds awesome? Let's move on.

## What do you need?
* `UiPath Studio`. Download community version (free) here.
    * https://www.uipath.com/developers/community-edition-download
* A `LinkedIn` account (of course).
* A `Microsoft Azure` account to activate `Text Analytics Service` (but this is not necessary, we will provide you a test key, unless the test key doesn't work anymore or you want to use your own key). The instructions for this key will be at the end of the tutorial.

## Let's do it

### 1. Launch UiPath Studio

First things first, open UiPath Studio and create a Blank Process as shown below.

### 2. Create the Skeleton Workflow

* In the `Flow Decision` put `Directory.GetFiles(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory + "\Input").Count > 0` in `Condition` under the `Properties panel` to check if there's any file in `Input` folder.

* Put `00:00:02` in `duration` in `delay` to only check if there's any new file in `Input` folder every 2 seconds.

* Every process on the left is a `Try Catch` activity.

### 3. Open & Login LinkedIn

> Please use Chrome for the sake of stability.
> Then in UiPath Studio, click `Start` > `Tools` > click `Chrome Extension` and install it.

* In the `Try` frame, use `Record` to log into LinkedIn.

You will have somthing like this:

### 4. Read File & Generate Hashtags
This part is going to be a bit challenging, but don't worry, we will make it as clear as possible.
* In the first `Assign` and type `folderPath` and put `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory + "\Input"` in the right box.
    * This will get the directory to `Input` folder.
    
* In the second `Assign` put `lastModFile` = `Directory.GetFiles(folderPath,"*.*",SearchOption.AllDirectories).OrderByDescending(Function(d) New FileInfo(d).CreationTime).Tolist(0)`.
    * This is just a piece of Visual Basic code to get the newest file in the folder.
    * Make sure the scope of 'lastModFile' is global to the whole flow chart.
    
* `Attended Robot Status` is just to output a message to the screen and you can put and message in double quotes in its `Message` property.
    * If you don't have `Attended Robot Status`, go to `Manage Packages` and search for `AttendedRobotStatus` in `All Packages`.
* If you don't have `Read PDF with OCR`, install `UiPath.PDF.Activities` in `Manage Packages`.
    * Drag `Microsoft OCR` activity into it as a scanning engine and create a variable called`articleContent` in property `Text` of `Microsoft OCR`.
* If you don't have `Microsoft Text Analysis`, install `UiPath.Cognitive.Activities`.
    * In its properties, set `Key` = `"fd0ca4c4139a4111b4a5280b65d512bc"` (this is for testing purposes, you can use yours).
    * Set `Text` to `articleContent`.
    * Set `AnalysisType` to `KeyPhrases`.
    * Create new varible `keyPhrases` in `KeyPhrases`.
* In the `For Each` loop, we have:
        * `tag` = `item.ToString.Replace(" ", "").Insert(0, "#").Replace("-","").Replace("'","")` to clean the string.
        * `hashtags` = `String.Join(" ", hashtags, tag)` to create a string of hashtags. Make sure `hashtags` is global to the whole workflow.

### 5. Post Article to Linkedin
Use Web Recorder to post the article to LinkedIn
* Click on the attachment icon on your logged in home page.
* Paste the `lastModFile` into `File Name`

You will have something like this:

* put `hashtags` into the first `Type Into` activity, change its `WaitForReady` property to `COMPLETE` to make sure it's completed before the next step.
* Assign `fileName` to `Path.GetFileName(lastModFile)` to get the title of the file.
* Put `filename.Replace(".pdf", "")` into the second `Type Into` activity to delete the ".pdf". Make sure its `WaitForReady` is also `COMPLETE`.
* 'Click' Post.

> If you get stuck with the selectors (LinkedIn is a bit tricky), use our selectors:
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />
` for the first and second "attached browser".
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl aaname='            Upload document   ' idx='2' />` for clicking attachment button.

> In the second "attach browser":
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl aaname='   What do you want to talk about?      ' />` for the first `Type Into`.
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl id='document-share-preview__title-input' tag='INPUT' />` for the second `Type Into`.
> * Use `<html app='chrome.exe' title='*LinkedIn' />`
> `<webctrl tag='BUTTON' aaname='            Post  ' />` for the Post button.
